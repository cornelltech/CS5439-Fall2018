# Syllabus for CS 5439

Welcome to CS 5439, Practicum in Computer Security. The goal is to learn
about computer security as seen in practice. The class can be taken as a supplement to
the security survey course CS 5435, or by itself. 

For Fall 2018 the practicum will focus on the technology-related threat models
that arise in intimate partner violence (IPV), which is sexual, physical,
financial, technological, or emotional violence against an intimate partner. IPV
is experienced by roughly one quarter of women and one sixth of men at some
point in their lives.  We will learn about how abusers exploit technology to spy
on, harass, or otherwise harm their victims.  We will investigate how security
mechanism design fails to account for attackers with intimate knowledge of the
target and physical access to devices. We will explore ways to improve
technology to better empower (potential) victims.  Homeworks will be designed to
not only gain understanding and appreciation of computer security mechanisms,
but also to produce materials useful in practice for advocates and survivors of
technology abuse.

### Background reading and Lecture notes

For an easy introduction to some of the issues, check out a mainstream [press article we wrote](https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2018/5/21/17374434/intimate-partner-violence-spyware-domestic-abusers-apple-google),
  and some
  [coverage of our work](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/19/technology/phone-apps-stalking.html)
   in the NY Times. These articles provide a good overview of a subset of the
  tech issues we will discuss in the class, namely spyware. For more in-depth discussion, see our 
  [IPV Tech Research group website](https://ipvtechresearch.org/) and [research papers](https://www.ipvtechresearch.org/post/publications/).
